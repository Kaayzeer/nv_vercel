      "Running out of options can be costly. When it comes to brand names and domains, many businesses have learned this the hard way. The alternatives may suddenly be to pay an inflated price for the domain you need, stay on a bad option, or even rebrand.",
    subTitle2:
      " The domain name is not something that will just fall into place, or that can be handled later. The domain is your digital brand name, and securing the exact match for it should be top priority. Allowing yourself to make an informed and strategic choice in the early stages of development can save you a world of trouble down the line. That is why Next Venture offers the naming service “Find”.",

      "Even if your perfect domain is taken, it may still be possible to acquire! Why not give it a shot? The alternative may very well prove more expensive in the long run. ",
    subTitle2:
      " Next Venture does things differently. Domain name brokers normally charge a commission based on the purchase price. In practice this often means that even though you only pay upon success, both compensation and purchase price is likely going to be high. Some brokers charge up to 20% of the price and have no incentive to keep the purchase price down. The higher the price – the higher the compensation. It is also a fact that while some domain acquisitions take great time and effort to achieve – others require close to none. As a client it is not likely that you will know.",
    subTitle3:
      "In addition, legacy domain name brokers have lukewarm interest in low budget acquisitions. This is why Next Venture has developed a sophisticated system for domain name acquisition projects where you follow the process and weigh your options every step of the way. That way you can keep tabs on costs and progress, and only pay for the actual work laid down. Our agents are skilled in research and negotiation, and ready to tackle any challenge. Give them one! If the perfect domain can be yours - it will be. Take the opportunity to acquire that perfect domain, before it’s gone forever ",

This is why Next Venture offers the domain sales service “Sell”, to connect supply with demand. Depending on the nature of the asset, we offer different sales and marketplace optimization services. ",
    subTitle2:
      " A little bit of extra funding can go a long way. For a startup it can mean the world. For an individual it can mean life or death. For a corporation; an extra injection of funds for a project. Don’t sit idle on sellable domain assets that could be of more use in the form of funds.",
    subTitle3:
      "The domains that fetch the best price on the aftermarket are one word brandable names under the .COM extension. Appealing two word domains are also sought after, as well as short and pronounceable 3-5 letter names. Outside of .COM, extensions such as .IO, .XYZ, AI and .CO have found success among startups. Let us know about the domain assets you want to divest and find out what we can do for you!",
